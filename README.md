  With **Flutter** you can make an application for both an Android and iOS level. Before I move further about flutter we know some terminologies.
  
  + **SDK** (Software Development Kit) :-
  
    A software development kit is typically aset of *Software Development Tools* that allows the creation of an applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console,operating system or similar development platform.
     
  + **Framework** :-
    
    A framework or software framework is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform.
    
  + **What is Flutter?** :-
  
    Flutter is one software development kit which is made by **Google** for the creation of 2D mobile applications. Dart is supported language for Flutter.
   
  + **Flutter Advantage** :-
  
   1. ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE :- Flutter allows developers to create native applications for both iOS and an Android.
   2. EASY LEARNING CURVE :- Flutter has a very easy learning curve. (Must required knowledge of Object Oriented Programming.)
   3. IMPROVE YOUR RESUME :- Flutter is new and trending. This only makes your rsume more lucrative and provides a higher chance at getting hired.
   
  + **Flutter Architecture** :-
  
    1. Widget Tree:- An application built using flutter is designed using widgets. Everything is widget. 
    2. Embrace Platform Difference :- Flutter embraces the difference gracefully as iOS and an Android behave differently for how service API's are called and handled.
